# Reinforcement learning  
This repository is to keep track of my work for my Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP). The code draws upon methods dicussed in 
the book 'Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction' 
by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton. 

# Q-learning (off policy TD control) to a grid-world environment
Q-learning is a powerful off-policy temporal-difference (TD) control algorithm which can be used to outline the optimal action based on the current state of the agent.
Q-learning has shown promising results in various fields, such as robotics, autonomous
systems, and game playing, where finding the optimal action is essential for achieving
specific goals. This report investigates the use of Q-learning in a grid-world environment to develop the optimal policy in which an agent should take to maximise the
cumulative reward.


The image below shows the reward structure for the grid-world environment.
